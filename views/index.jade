                With VenFu, you have serious options. You can find a vendor, order food now, and either pick it up or 
                have it delivered--just like you'd expect... Or you can schedule an order now and get it later, when 
                and where it's convenient for you.

                As a VenFu vendor, you have the ability to focus on what you love, which is making food. 
                VenFu is a tool that gives vendors easy access to customers, delivery, and all the other so-called 
                "management" stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the art of making delicious foods.
